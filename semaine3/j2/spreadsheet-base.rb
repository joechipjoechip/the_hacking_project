# You always need to save the worksheet to persist changes back to the spreadsheet. If you want to insert a row at the bottom of all existing rows, use the num_rows method.

# To update a cell you can reference the cell by row and column number:
worksheet[2, 1] = "Updated!"
worksheet.save


# You can also use the cell name:
worksheet["A2"] = "Updated again!"
worksheet.save


# Deleting rows is like inserting rows, you need to provide the row number and how many rows youâ€™d like to delete:
worksheet.delete_rows(2, 1)
worksheet.save
